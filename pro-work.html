            PRO WORK
         </h1>

            <p>In my time on this planet, I've had incredible opportunities to work with multiple companies and organizations. I have much experience in rebranding company logos and marketing material as well as creating marketing videography for organizational recruitment purposes. Below are some of the companies I have worked with and what I have done with them.</p>

         <div class="pro">
             <div class="outposttext">I have been working for the University Outpost Bookstore down in Harrisonburg, Virginia for the past year. I am the Director of Social Media and Marketing Development, where I am responsible for managing the company's social media accounts as well as creating graphics such as web banners, window posters, business cards, email blasts and social media posts.</div>

             <div class="bluestonetext">I have been a Creative Director for the student-run PR firm here at JMU, Bluestone Communications, for two semesters now. I recently got promoted to Executive Creative Director, where I oversee the firm's entire creative team. I served on the Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative account last semester, where we had the opportunity to redesign and create deliverables such as program logos, brochure designs and a brand book. This semester, I am serving on the JMU School of Communication Studies account team.</div>

             <div class="phimutext">I have had the absolute privilege of serving my chapter of Phi Mu for the past year as the Historian Chairman. I am responsible for the preproduction, production and postproduction of the Formal Recruitment videos and other documentation media for the Gamma Theta chapter. I have been blessed with holding the position for the second year in a row now and am beginning to plan the next set of recruitment videos for this upcoming August.
