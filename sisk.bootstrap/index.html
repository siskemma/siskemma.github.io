  <p>My real name is Emma Sisk - but I'm just trying to be edgy for the website, okay? I'm 21, I love steak and cheese subs and I like to make things in my free time, whether that be an animation or a bleached pair of jeans. In my artistic career, I've practiced graphic design, video production, tattoo design, web coding and more. My friends describe me as creative, hard working, passionate, driven and adventurous. I would describe myself as a creator.</p>
  <p>In high school, I spent three years as the Chief Design Editor on my yearbook staff, where I developed my passion for graphic and print publication design. My passion for videography emerged around the beginning of my college career, and it hasn't stopped growing since. In the past three years of my college experience, I've been able to create a multitude of promotional videos for campus organizations.</p>    
  <p>Currently, I'm a rising senior double major student at James Madison University where I study Interactive Design and Communications. Off campus, I work part-time for The University Outpost Bookstore, where I am the Director of Social Media and Marketing Development. At The Outpost, I help promote the company through social media as well as produce graphic deliverables such as web banners, window posters, stickers and email blasts for marketing. On campus, I am honored to serve as my sorority's Historian Chairman where I am responsible for producing our Formal Recruitment videoraphy. Additionally, I serve as the Executive Creative Director for Bluestone Communications, JMU's nationally affiliated, student-run public relations firm.</p>
